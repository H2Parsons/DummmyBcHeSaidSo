LISTS  

Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.  
  
Unordered lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens — interchangably — as list markers:

*   Red
*   Green
*   Blue
is equivalent to:

+   Red
+   Green
+   Blue
and:

-   Red
-   Green
-   Blue
Ordered lists use numbers followed by periods:

1.  Bird
2.  McHale
3.  Parish
